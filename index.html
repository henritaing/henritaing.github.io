          <h2>Social Tracker - Basildon Social Impact Hackathon</h2>
          <h2>HTML, CSS, Python (Flask)</h2>
          <p>5 days, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday during my exam period. The timing could have been worse, it could have been during my vacation, I guess. </p>
          <p>I chose to participate because of three main reasons. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>I wanted to try the Hackathon experience without having to kill myself. </li>
            <li>While we couldn't finish the project, it was the extra motivation I needed to learn Python Flask. </li>
            <li>The event had a purpose I could stand behind. </li>
          </ul> 
          <p>And so, with the help of a retired professor, I went on to tackle this challenge, and came up with the idea of a social tracker to monitor and guide social policies. You will find the code on my GitHub or by clicking on the following link,</p>

          <h2>Data Visualization - Columbia Speed Dating Event</h2>
          <h2>Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly)</h2>
          <p>A fun project to explore Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Plotly during Centrale Méditerranée.</p>
          <p>I was surprised by the results I got on the women side. I didn't expect that honestly.</p>
          <p>I guess, I'm still young and innocent.</p>

          <h2>Relationship mapping - A way to map your friends for your parents to remember</h2>
          <h2></h2>
          <p>I am lucky to have made many friends during the different periods of my life.</p>
          <p>But it also means that when I tell my mom about them, she keeps forgetting who's who and how I got to know them.</p>
          <p>So, as a mean to draw her a clearer picture, I had this idea of mapping my friends like we'd map processes in consulting (-> #youcanleaveconsultingbutconsultingdoesn'tleaveyou).</p>
          <p>Then I realized that I could use it to see who could fit with whom and it comes into handy since I love making crossovers between my different friends' groups, albeit not too successful sometimes.</p>
