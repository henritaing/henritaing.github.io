          <h2>Social Tracker - Basildon Social Impact Hackathon</h2>
          <p>5 days, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday during my exam period. The timing could have been worse, it could have been during my vacation, I guess. <br>

I chose to participate because of three main reasons. <br>

I wanted to try the Hackathon experience without having to kill myself. <br>
While we couldn't finish the project, it was the extra motivation I needed to learn Python Flask. <br>
The event had a purpose I could stand behind. <br>
And so, with the help of a retired professor, I went on to tackle this challenge, and came up with the idea of a social tracker to monitor and guide social policies. You will find the code on my GitHub or by clicking on the following link,</p>
